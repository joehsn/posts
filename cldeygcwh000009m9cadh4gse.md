# Sitemaps

# What are Sitemaps?

A sitemap is a file that lists URLs for a site with metadata about each URL so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site. 

We use sitemaps to provide information about the types of content on your pages:

* An image entry can include the location of the images included on a page.
    
* A new entry can include the article title and publication date.
    
* A video entry can specify the video running time, rating, and age-appropriateness rating.
    

also provides valuable information about these files. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the sitemap and learn about those URLs using the associated metadata. Using the sitemap does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines, **but it provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site**.

## Do you need a sitemap?

No, if the pages on your website are properly linked.

No, if your website is a small one. 

No, if your website lacks many media files (video, image, etc.) or news pages.

No, if you're utilizing a CMS like WordPress, Wix, or Blogger.

But you might require one if:

* Your site is really large
    
* Your site is new and has few external links to it
    
* Your site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News
    
* Your site has a large archive of content pages that are isolated or not well-linked to each other
    

According to how big your website is, this is why having a large website may make things more difficult:
